            I'm a fourth year engineering student at Memorial University of Newfoundland. I am interested in various fields of software development such as robotics, 
            simulation development and graphics programming. I have experience in desktop application development, web development and ROS development. This website
            is meant to highlight my experience, projects, and achievements.

                I worked on a map based web application used by researchers to visualize 5G networks 
                and interference simulation results. I used React to add features to the application along with 
                JavaScript libraries such as Leaflet for map components and Plotly.js for displaying data.

              <p>I worked on a battle space simulation desktop application. The application is desgined to be used on
                Avalon's Holographics' 3D displays. The app features a 3D render of earth and allows users to upload 3D
                tilesets of any city and display them on the 3D displays. I used C++ along with the ImGui library to add features
                to the application. I also used HLSL to add different shading effects.

             <p>I was a member of the Access Engineering team in St. John's, NL. This team is focused on

              data entry and I created a script to sort house addresses from across the province.

              <p> Iceberg ASV is a student design team at MUN. We build a self drving boat from scratch and compete at RoboBoats annual competition in Florida. I am 
                a member of the software team where myself and the other members write code that enables the boat to autonomously navigate through obstacle courses at competions.
                Recently I joined 7 other team members at the annual Njord Autonomous Ship Challenge in Trondheim, Norway where we placed fifth overall.
