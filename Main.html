            I'm a fourth year engineering student at Memorial University of Newfoundland. I am interested in various fields of software development such as robotics, 
            simulation development and graphics programming. I have experience in desktop application development, web development and ROS development. This website
            is meant to highlight my experience, projects, and achievements.

                I worked on a map based web application used by researchers to visualize 5G networks 
                and interference simulation results. I used React to add features to the application along with 
                JavaScript libraries such as Leaflet for map components and Plotly.js for displaying data.

              <p>I worked on a battle space simulation desktop application. The application is desgined to be used on
                Avalon's Holographics' 3D displays. The app features a 3D render of earth and allows users to upload 3D
                tilesets of any city and display them on the 3D displays. I used C++ along with the ImGui library to add features
                to the application. I also used HLSL to add different shading effects.

             <p>I was a member of the Access Engineering team in St. John's, NL. This team is focused on
              expanding Bell's fibre optic internet services to rural communities across Newfoundland. During
              my time with the team I completed various upgrades to their Microsoft Access database including automating
              data entry and I created a script to sort house addresses from across the province.

              <p> Iceberg ASV is a student design team at MUN. We build a self drving boat from scratch and compete at RoboBoats annual competition in Florida. I am 
                a member of the software team where myself and the other members write code that enables the boat to autonomously navigate through obstacle courses at competions.
                Recently I joined 7 other team members at the annual Njord Autonomous Ship Challenge in Trondheim, Norway where we placed fifth overall.
